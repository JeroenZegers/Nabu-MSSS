"""Module implementing RNN Cells.
This module provides a number of basic commonly used RNN cells, such as LSTM
(Long Short Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and a number of
operators that allow adding dropouts, projections, or embeddings for inputs.
Constructing multi-layer cells is supported by the class `MultiRNNCell`, or by
calling the `rnn` ops several times.

  """Abstract object representing an RNN cell.
  Every `RNNCell` must have the properties below and implement `call` with
  the signature `(output, next_state) = call(input, state)`.  The optional
  third input argument, `scope`, is allowed for backwards compatibility
  purposes; but should be left off for new subclasses.
  This definition of cell differs from the definition used in the literature.
  In the literature, 'cell' refers to an object with a single scalar output.
  This definition refers to a horizontal array of such units.
  An RNN cell, in the most abstract setting, is anything that has
  a state and performs some operation that takes a matrix of inputs.
  This operation results in an output matrix with `self.output_size` columns.
  If `self.state_size` is an integer, this operation also results in a new
  state matrix with `self.state_size` columns.  If `self.state_size` is a
  (possibly nested tuple of) TensorShape object(s), then it should return a
  matching structure of Tensors having shape `[batch_size].concatenate(s)`
  for each `s` in `self.batch_size`.
